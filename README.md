# Welcome to easyCSS.
I created easyCSS to make work with css alot easier.  
Plus I found that Bootstrap were missing some basic css code. 
### THIS WILL WORK BEST COMBINED WITH BOOTSTRAP5! [How to install it](https://getbootstrap.com/) 

# What can you expect?
easyCSS is for the most basics of css like handling flexboxes, and YES even center it using 
```html
  <div class="flex-center vh-100 w-100">A centered Div!</div> 
```
In this readme file I will help you to use easyCSS.  
  
## How to install easyCSS

You can install easyCSS by using either my Content-Delivery-Network or for better performance download it on your own server.

#### CDN:
To use the CDN version you can copy and add this into your ``<head></head>`` section at the start of the html file.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.shyfox.de/easyCSS/v1/easyCSS.css" integrity="sha384-iHMq23QUWciHl/lUx9pBq61mHiD7y9h7oIOnDDmwzivyrcfE/X1KXFDsMCYDszg/" crossorigin="anonymous">
```
  
#### Download
To use the downloaded version, you need to download the file from github and upload it into a folder within the visible part of the website like an assets folder and add  
the following code inside the ``<head></head>`` section at the start of the html file.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/css/file"
```

Replace ``/path/to/css/file/`` with the actual path where you saved it like ``/assets/css/easyCSS.css``
