# Welcome to easyCSS.
I created easyCSS to make work with css alot easier.  
Plus I found that Bootstrap were missing some basic css code. 
### THIS WILL WORK BEST COMBINED WITH BOOTSTRAP5! [How to install it](https://getbootstrap.com/) 

# What can you expect?
easyCSS is for the most basics of css like handling flexboxes, and YES even center it using 
```html
  <div class="flex-center vh-100 w-100">A centered Div!</div> 
```
In this readme file I will help you to use easyCSS.
